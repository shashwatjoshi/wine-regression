"# wine-regression" 


Wine value evaluation to predict the value of wines before their maturation .
It uses a logistic regression model with a data rage from 1952- 1978.
The dependent variable here which we aim to predict is the price of the wine and the independent variable used are the Average season growing temperature, Harvest rain, Winter rain and the Age of the wine.

•	As this being one of my initial projects I learned the importance of checking the accuracy with the baseline and how to determine a base line in our model. 
•	I learned interpretation of R squared value along with the use of sum of squared errors and the interpretation of the coefficients of the model which is obtained by the summary function in R. 
•	The knowledge of the correlation of the variables and how this correlation affects the performance of our regression model.
